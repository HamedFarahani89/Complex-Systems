In this repository, I am trying to put whatever I am facing with in the field of complex systems. The focus is the simplicity and comprehensibility of codes and concepts. If you have a comment, please do not hesitate to contact me.

# Complex Systems definition

Concisely, there are plenty of systems in nature which are interconcted and exibit highly nonlinear deterministic as well as stochastic characteristic and are regulated
hierarchically called complex systems. decomposition startegy does not work to gain insight into behavior complex systems.
