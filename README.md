# Complex-Systems
In this repository, I am trying to put whatever I am facing with in the field of complex systems. The focus is the simplicity and comprehensibility of codes and concepts. If you have a comment, please do not hesitate to contact me.

# Complex Systems definition

concisely, There are plenty of systems in nature which are interconcted and exibit highly nonlinear deterministic as well as stochastic characteristic and are regulated
hierarchically called complex systems. decomposition startegy does not work to gain insight into behavior complex systems.


# Weierstrass function:

The Weierstrass function is continuous on the whole domain, though non-differentiable anywhere. It is a self-similar fractal, which means, that on a large scale it looks the same as do some smaller parts of it after magnification. It would be great If you need to produce a monofractal with a specific D-fractal.

# Fractional Brownian motion

In probability theory, fractional Brownian motion (fBm), also called a fractal Brownian motion, is a generalization of Brownian motion.

fBm is a continuous-time Gaussian process BH(t) on [0, T], that starts at zero, has expectation zero for all t in [0, T], and has the following covariance function:
