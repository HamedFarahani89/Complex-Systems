# Complex-Systems
In this repository, I am trying to put whatever I am facing with in the field of complex systems. The focus is the simplicity and comprehensibility of codes and concepts. If you have a comment, please do not hesitate to contact me.

# Weierstrass function:

The Weierstrass function is continuous on the whole domain, though non-differentiable anywhere. It is a self-similar fractal, which means, that on a large scale it looks the same as do some smaller parts of it after magnification. It would be great If you need to produce a monofractal with a specific D-fractal.

[you can check its Wikipedia out  ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function)

# Fractional Brownian motion

In probability theory, fractional Brownian motion (fBm), also called a fractal Brownian motion, is a generalization of Brownian motion.
